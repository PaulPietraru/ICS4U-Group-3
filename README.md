# ICS4U-Group-3

This is the repository for the tiles_game project.

Clone this project into a local folder named tiles_game. This is required by Processing.
Ideally this folder should be under the sketchbook location folder configured in Processing preferences.

The initial commit was done on branch master. 
Each member of the project should create a branch with his own name (example: PaulPietraru) and work on that branch.

We will decide when to merge each work branch in the master branch based on the evolution of the project.
